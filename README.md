# Convex-Otimization
This repository includes the report and the .ipynb files of the Convex Optimization project, which contain answers to the theory problems and the code's results and explanations.
- Defining a random convex optimization problem and adding new assumptions lead to using the SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) algorithm to solve it. To solve the problem, various theoretical problems have been proven, and algorithms have been implemented.
